# CarRental - Car Rental System

Welcome to the `CarRental` project!

The goal of this project is to implement a simple car rental management system. Your task is to create a class that implements the `CarRental` interface.

## Requirements

*   Java 25
*   Maven

## Instructions

- [X] Open the file `src/main/java/org/example/CarRental.java`.
- [X] Familiarize yourself with the methods you need to implement. The comments in the code will guide you on what each method should do.
- [X] Create a new class (e.g., `CarRentalImpl`) that implements this interface.
- [X] Write code for each method to meet the business requirements.

## Testing

The project includes the JUnit 5 dependency. You can (and should!) write unit tests to verify the correctness of your solution.
